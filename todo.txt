- clear filters button on transactions
- check out a loading panel

- gotta fix up the shit login loop

- seed koji izbrise sve account, categories i transakcije
- add tags for transationcs
- add crud for tags
- filters multi select transactions
- look good on mobile
- change order of income/expense for transaction dialog


📈 Better error handling - Global error boundaries, graceful failures
📈 Loading states - Spinners, skeleton screens
📈 More complex filtering - Date ranges, multi-select, search
📈 Responsive polish - Make mobile experience great, not just "works"
📈 Seeded demo data - So reviewers can see it populated immediately
📈 README with screenshots - Show it off properly
Current weaknesses:
⚠️ Login loop bug - This will hurt in demos
⚠️ Limited mobile responsiveness - "A bit" isn't enough for 2025
⚠️ No demo/live version? - Hard to show off without deployment
